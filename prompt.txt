Ok, I have a skeletal rails app with the functionalities I need (basic table views, forms, etc).
Now i want to add styling, css etc to make it look less like shit.
I want a navbar, nice buttons, decent table views.
Please specify what i need to do in details. stick to rails principles.
I want to use tailwind css and stimulus controllers where needed. 

Navbar - 
Should include a link to the dashboard, as well as to an auto updating list of resources, for each resource the link will go to the index action in the controller.
The navbar should only be visible when the user is logged in, otherwise display nothing.
It should be sticky to the top of the screen, and look good on mobile.

Index page - 
for each resource index page, display a well formatted table of all the records, where which attributes are presented is defined in the model.
each row should have an edit and view button, which will include more data, also defined in the model. the view and edit should pop up as modals.
The table should have a search bar, and a button to create a new record.
The search bar should be used to search for a record in the table.
The create button should go to the new action in the controller.
The index screen and all sub-screens (modals) should look good on mobile.

Please set it up so the basic structure of the resource page is set up in a partial, and reused across resource views.
